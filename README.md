# 42-submit-action
A github action that submits specified part of the repo to intra.42.fr with the latest commit message

# ðŸ›‘ Warning! Work in progress! ðŸ›‘

Todo:

+ Design parameters
    * passing author and commit message as optional parameter (for manual dispatch)
+ Test commiting the whole repo and subdirs
    * add multiple dirs?
+ Example workflows (especially examples that use event_dispatch and change commit message)
+ Docs overall

# Things to read while the docs are absent

Example usage in a minishell project repo:
https://github.com/Oktosha/codam-minishell/blob/920cc45715a3d70bb6be984979ced78aa3a34d1f/.github/workflows/submit.yml

## Notes

A sensetive env variable is "unset" by assigning an empty line to it

```yaml
run: echo "SSH_AUTH_SOCK=" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
```

At the moment of writing there is no way to *unset* an env variable in an action, so I only override it https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1126
